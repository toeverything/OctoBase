OctoBase is an offline-available, scalable, self-contained collaborative database, which was originally designed for AFFiNE. AFFiNE is a local-first open source knowledge base that provides full functionality in any network environment.

Based on OctoBase, you can not only implement a rich text editor for offline writing, but also implement richer offline collaboration functions based on OctoBase's data abstraction, such as: multidimensional tables, drawing boards, etc.

As an offline collaborative data database, OctoBase has the following characteristics:

- 📚 **Multi-platform available** offline collaboration, Schemaless, structured/unstructured/rich text data storage .

- 🗃️ **Binary storage** that supports data deduplication and rich media editing.

- 🔍 **High-performance real-time full-text indexing** with high-quality multilingual word segmentation support.

- 🌐 **Point-to-point / central server synchronization** with rich multi-platform native support.

- 🔒 **Fine-grained permission control** with advanced permission management.

By providing native offline collaboration, full-text indexing, and binary storage, OctoBase enables you to easily build secure, high-performance local-first collaborative applications using the same set of data abstractions on multiple platforms.

OctoBase can be used either as a stand-alone server database, or directly included in your application as an embedded database and remain fully functional.

## Project status

**The OctoBase project is currently under heavy development, most components are not yet production ready. Major changes may occur at any time before the version reaches 1.0.**

## Goals

OctoBase aims to make it easy for developers to build local-first applications
on all common platforms. In order to achieve this goal, we will strive to do these things:

- Make it easy to build on all supported platforms.
- Implement basic data types that support collaboration.
- Support peer-to-peer synchronization.
- Self-contained library distribution.
- Minimize external dependencies.

## Building

```bash
# install rust toolchain
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/toeverything/octobase/
# start sync server
cargo run --bin keck
```

Now you can access <http://localhost:3000/api/docs/> through the browser.

This is a simple http interface binding, which allows you to modify the data in octobase with the http interface; you can also statically link octobase to your program, modify the data through native api, and synchronize with other clients.

In the process of project development, there are many software development concepts that have influenced us. Thank you very much for these excellent software:

- [Fossil] -- Source code management tool made with CRDTs which inspired our design on block data structure.
- [SQLite] -- "Small. Fast. Reliable. Choose any three." We like this idea very much.
