# Make a collaborative Todo MVC with OctoBase

This is a tutorial on how to make a collaborative Todo MVC with OctoBase.

Todo MVC provides the functions of adding, deleting and searching for todo data. Even if it is offline, the data edited can be merged with the server or other clients without conflict.

We will be using the OctoBase JavaScript SDK to make the app.
